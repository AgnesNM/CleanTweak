## Introduction
This is a project that is to be pitched a month from now at East Africa Com. I kid you not, it was an idea that was born 2 days ago, and I intend to get all the help I can, and learn as much to make it a success.

CleanTweak is a digital marketing tool that collates all your old published content. This should help marketers and marketing teams to repackage it in the most creative ways possible. How it should work is that the user should input their brand name and year, and then the tool should collate and output all the published content types it can find online.
